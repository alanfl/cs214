# Test Plan

<p>The following outlines the test plan for Assignment 0.
</p>

---
## Check Parsing and Tokenizer
<p>The following inputs check if the tokenizer is successfully parsing
both expressions and tokens. We are not checking errors at this point.
</p>

1. `a`

2. `a + b`

---
## Parse Errors

<p>The following inputs contain tokens that should result in parse errors, although
the resultant expression would not be illegal if the tokens were valid.
</p>

1. `a + b`

2. `1 * asdf`

3. `trur AND false`

4. `true ANND false`

5. `true AND falxe`

6.

---
## Invalid Expressions

<p>The following inputs contain tokens that are all valid, but are combined in such a way
that the resultant expression is illegal
</p>

---
## Mixed Errors

<p>The following inputs contain tokens that are invalid, as well as illegal expressions
</p>
